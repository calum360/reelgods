        <p>We respect your privacy. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard personal data in compliance with the GDPR (EU), CCPA (US/California), and other relevant international privacy laws.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Collection</strong><br>
        We collect only the information you voluntarily provide through our contact form — typically your name, business email, and message. We do not track users or engage in invasive data profiling.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Usage</strong><br>
        Your submitted data is used solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except where legally required or to facilitate a requested transaction (e.g. via Escrow.com).</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        This site uses minimal, functional cookies (e.g. for site preferences and security). We do not use analytics cookies or third-party advertising trackers.</p>

        <p><strong>Your Rights</strong><br>
        You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. To make such a request, email <a href="mailto:support@reelgods.com" style="color:#ffd700; text-decoration:none;">support@reelgods.com</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Retention</strong><br>
        We retain contact form submissions for a maximum of 12 months, or until the inquiry is resolved — whichever is shorter. You may request earlier deletion at any time.</p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
        All communication is encrypted via HTTPS. We take all reasonable steps to safeguard your data from unauthorized access.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact</strong><br>
        For privacy-related questions or concerns, email us directly at <a href="mailto:support@reelgods.com" style="color:#ffd700; text-decoration:none;">support@reelgods.com</a>.</p>
